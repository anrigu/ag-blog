#### August 19, 2020 by [Anri Gu](/about)

Hi! My name is Anri! I’m a former student of Tomken (Go Tigers!) and the SciTech Program currently entering my last year at John Fraser Secondary School. Some of you may be 
wondering why I created this blog! I've always been interested in giving back to the community, a hobby that started at Tomken (fun fact: My fascination with giving back started
during an ID Lab where we helped members of the community with gardening!) But, often, I felt my attempts to give back were halted by others' perspective of me. After all, I'm
only a high school kid from a small suburb near Toronto. So, if I couldn't make an impact on a bigger scale, I thought giving back to communities I grew up in would be a good 
place to start! (If you want to learn more about my journey, go to the [about](/about) page) This is a platform made for you, the students! Feeling lost? Read some experiences
former students have gone through! In a mood to write (about anything!)? [Create an account](/registration), and [post an article](/postArticle) under the opinion or all category! Imagine if your story could 
motivate a younger student - 10, 20, 30 years in the future - to pursue their dreams! You have no idea what impact your experiences can have on others! Let your voice be heard! `;

When I was in middle school – in your very place – I always wished there was a voice telling me what to do: what opportunities to take, 
what moments should be cherished, what assignments are important. Today, as I enter the 12th grade and look back at my Grade 6,7 and 8 experience, 
I realized that throughout my education, my favourite years were those that were spent at Tomken 
(by the way, this is a shared sentiment by all of my friends who went to Tomken as well!). 
This blog is a resource where you can not only read all about our experiences, thoughts, and ideas, 
but a space where you can share your personal stories so that younger generations can learn from your stories! 

Please, share all your amazing experiences! Do you have strong opinions on a topic? Share them in the [opinions](/postPage/opinions/) tab! Any amazing experiences 
at Tomken you'd like to talk about? Let others know! Talk about the good, the bad, the happy, the sad, the fun, the boring experience(s) you've had! This is a 
platform where you can let loose! Have fun sharing! `;
