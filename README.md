# ag-blog

This is a blog I designed to aid rising high school freshmen learn more about the high school experience and the opportunities that are open to them at 
this stage of their education. I talk about the struggles of starting my own club, the struggle in finding the right work-life balance. This blog also 
functioned as a forum in which other, high school students could post their own experiences! In late 2019, the app was integrated and used by a number of classes at middle school as a guidance tool for graduating students. It continues to be used today.  

# Tools

I developed the frontend of this blog in React using the Material-UI library. I also used React-Redux, Axios, and React Thunk for various logisitical aspects of the app.
The backend is designed around the Django Rest Framework (DRF).
